### Key Features

- **Fast Setup**  
Get started in <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **minutes**</span> with minimal configuration. Just provide your website URLs, and TestSprite's <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **AI agent**</span> takes it from there—so you can skip the manual setup and focus on what matters most: shipping great software.

- **Customizable, AI-Generated Test Cases**  
TestSprite dynamically creates <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **intelligent, real-time test plans**</span> tailored to your product's actual content and edge cases. You can easily <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **customize**</span> the prompts, adjust scenarios, or manually describe any additional flows you want covered. If our AI agent misses anything, you're always in control.

- **End-to-End Visibility** with <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **Smart Video Playback**</span>  
Every step taken by the AI agent—every button click, form fill, mouse action—is <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **recorded and replayable**</span>. This makes it easy to understand exactly how the test ran, spot UI issues visually, and validate the testing behavior from start to finish.

- **Web-Based Test Execution Preview**  
Watch test execution unfold <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **live in the browser**</span>. Monitor interactions in real time to catch potential issues instantly, and understand exactly how your users will experience the application.

- **Actionable, Detailed Reports**  
Each test run comes with an <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **execution report**</span> including error message, root cause analysis, and suggested fixes. Our AI not only flags issues but also helps you resolve them faster with meaningful insights.

- **Natural Language Feedback Loop**  
Refine tests directly through <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **natural language**</span>. Want to tweak a scenario, add an edge case, or rerun a modified flow? Just tell the AI—no code required. You can even regenerate test cases instantly based on new test prompts.

- **Generated Test Code** (Python + Playwright)  
Alongside visual testing, TestSprite automatically generates <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **reusable test code**</span> (defaulting to Python with Playwright). It's perfect for future regression testing, CI/CD pipelines, or for developers who want full transparency into what's being run under the hood.

## Getting Started

To begin using TestSprite for front-end testing, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Front-End Testing Environment

1. **Log in** to your TestSprite account and go to the **Home** section.
2. Click on **Create a Test**. Once you've completed the backend (API) testing step, you'll be automatically guided to the front-end (UI) Testing step. You can also choose to <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **skip**</span> backend testing if you prefer to start with the front end.
3. Enter the **Web Application Details**:
   - Web application starting URL.
   - Any authentication credentials if needed (e.g., username, password).

    ```json
    {
      "Web application starting URL": "https://www.example.com",
      "Web application sign in username/email (optional)": "user@example.com",
      "Web application sign in password (optional)": "password123"
    }
    ```
4. **Add more URLs**: if you have multiple pages to test within the same flow.
5. **Add Special Testing Instructions** (Optional): 
If you have specific testing requirements or additional context that could help the AI generate a more accurate initial test plan, feel free to include them here. This step is optional but can enhance the quality and relevance of your tests.

### Step 2: Configure Test Plans

1. **Review the Draft Test Plan**:  
   **Review** the draft test plan *(Our AI may further refine this after performing a deeper real-time analysis of your application during test case execution)* generated for your application. It contains a set of end-to-end test scenarios specifically tailored to the UI you've provided. A sample draft might look like this:

>   - **Test the 'Log In' Link Functionality**:
>     Ensure that the 'Log In' link directs users to the correct login page, triggering authentication flows properly and guiding users to their dashboard or profile page after a successful login.
>
>   - **Test the 'Add to Cart' Button in Product Listings**:
>     Verify that clicking the 'Add to Cart' button accurately adds the selected product to the user's shopping cart, updates the cart count, and displays confirmation messages as expected.
>
>   - **Test the 'Close Banner' Button Functionality**:
>     Ensure that clicking the 'Close' button on pop-up banners, promotional messages, or notifications dismisses the banner correctly, without disrupting other page elements.
>
>   - **Verify Link Redirection for Page Load Accuracy**:
>     Confirm that navigation links redirect users to the intended pages, with appropriate loading times and accurate content display, ensuring a smooth browsing experience across different sections of your website.

2. **<span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **Select & Modify**</span> Scenarios to Execute**:  
Based on your needs, select the test scenarios you'd like the AI to implement and execute for your frontend UI components. You can also <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> **modify any Test Description directly**</span> to better align with your specific requirements or improve accuracy.

### Step 3: Run Your Tests

1. Click **Next** to start generating and executing your selected test cases.
2. Monitor progress through the **Web Preview** feature, which displays the tested page as actions are performed.
3. TestSprite will automatically validate UI interactions and generate a detailed result upon completion.

### Step 4: Review Test Results

After your test is complete, TestSprite provides a detailed report, for example:

## Advanced Features

### Web Preview for Context

TestSprite includes a **Web Preview** feature that allows you to visualize the testing process:

- Watch as each element is interacted with on your web page.
- Understand how the page responds to various actions.
- Quickly identify UI issues that might otherwise be missed.

### Using Natural Language to Refine and Regenerate Tests

TestSprite lets you easily refine or modify tests using natural language—no technical configuration required. Simply  <span style={{ color: "#10A363" }}> update the **Test Prompt**</span> to better reflect your intended behavior. For example:

> "Ensure that the 'Sign In' link directs users to the correct sign in page, triggering authemtication flows properly and guiding users to their dashboard or profile page after a successful login."

TestSprite interprets the **new Test Prompt** and adjusts the test accordingly, making it easier for you to refine test cases without needing to dive into complex configurations.
