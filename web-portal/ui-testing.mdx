### Web Preview for Context


TestSprite includes a Web Preview feature that allows you to visualize the testing process:

- Watch as each element is interacted with on your web page
- Understand how the page responds to various actions  
- Quickly identify UI issues that might otherwise be missed


### Using Natural Language to Refine and Regenerate Tests

Refine tests using plain English—no technical configuration required.

**How it works:**
1. Edit the test description in plain language
2. TestSprite automatically regenerates the test


**Example:**

```
Original: "Test login functionality"

Refined: "Ensure the Sign In link directs users to the login page and guides them to their dashboard after successful authentication."
```
