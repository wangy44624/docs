By the end of this guide, you'll have run your first **automated test suite**, seen AI generate comprehensive test plans, watched tests execute in the cloud, received detailed test reports, and applied **automatic bug fixes**.

<Info>
Before starting, ensure you have [TestSprite MCP Server installed](/mcp/installation) and **your IDE open**.
</Info>

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

**Start Your Application** - Make sure your application is running locally:

```bash Example
# For frontend applications (examples)
npm run dev          # Usually runs on port 3000, 5173, or 8080
 
# For backend applications (examples)
node index.js        # Usually runs on port 8000, 3001, or 4000
```

``` text Project Structure Example
my-project/
├── frontend/          # React, Vue, Angular, etc.
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
├── backend/           # Node.js, Python, etc.
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── ...
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

## Step 2: The Magic Command

Open **your IDE Chat** and follow these steps:
1. **Open** a new chat window in your IDE
2. **Type** the magic command:

```text icon="file-lines"
Can you test this project with TestSprite?
```

3. Drag and drop your project folder into the chat if you'd like to test a specific sub-project
4. Press  <kbd>⇧ Enter</kbd>

That's it! Your AI assistant will now take over and guide you through the entire testing process.

## Step 3: The Automated Workflow

Your AI assistant will automatically handle the **entire testing process** by running through these steps. It takes care of everything from understanding your project to running the actual tests, so you don't have to do any of the work manually.

Learn more about details steps at [Testing Workflow](/mcp/workflow).

## Step 4: Configuration (Required)

When the bootstrap tool opens, you must configure:

1. **Test Account Credentials** - If your app requires login:
```json Crediential Examples
Username: test@example.com
Password: your-test-password
```

2. **Application URLs:**
``` text URL Examples
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:4000
```

3. **Product Requirements Document** 

Upload existing PRD (required). Even a draft or low-quality PRD is fine. TestSprite AI will generate a normalized PRD based on your upload.

## Step 5: Review Test Results

After testing, you'll find these files in your project:

``` text Expandable After Testing Project Structure Example
testsprite_tests/
├── tmp/
│   ├── prd_files/                 # Uploaded PRD files
│   ├── config.json               # Test configuration
│   ├── code_summary.json         # Code analysis
│   ├── report_prompt.json        # AI analysis data
│   └── test_results.json         # Detailed test results
├── standard_prd.json             # Normalized PRD
├── TestSprite_MCP_Test_Report.md # Human-readable report
├── TestSprite_MCP_Test_Report.html # HTML report
├── TC001_Login_Success_with_Valid_Credentials.py
├── TC002_Login_Failure_with_Invalid_Credentials.py
└── ...                           # Additional test files
```

**Understanding Test Results** - The test report shows overall coverage, pass rate, failed tests with detailed failure analysis, and categories (Functional, UI/UX, Security, Performance).

## Step 6: Automatic Bug Fixes

**Request Fixes** - After reviewing the test results, simply ask:

```text icon="file-lines"
Please fix the codebase based on TestSprite testing results.
```

The AI will analyze failing tests, identify problematic code sections, apply targeted fixes automatically, re-run tests to verify fixes, and iterate until issues are resolved.

## Example Output

**Test Plan Generated:**
```json Expandable Test Plan Example

      ]
    }
    // ... 17 more test cases
  ]
}
```

**Test Report Summary:**
```json Expandable Test Report Summary Example
