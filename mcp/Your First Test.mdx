Experience the magic of TestSprite MCP Server with your first automated test in under 10 minutes.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> Run your first automated test suite  
<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> Seen AI generate comprehensive test plans  
<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> Watched tests execute in the cloud  
<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> Received detailed test reports  
<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> Applied automatic bug fixes

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> [TestSprite MCP Server installed](/mcp/installation)  
<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> A project with a running application (frontend/backend)  
<span className="material-icons">check_circle</span> Your IDE (Cursor or Windsurf) open

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

**Start Your Application** - Make sure your application is running locally:

```bash
# For frontend applications (examples)
npm run dev          # Usually runs on port 3000, 5173, or 8080

# For backend applications (examples)
node index.js        # Usually runs on port 8000, 3001, or 4000
```

**Example Project Structure:**
```
my-project/
├── frontend/          # React, Vue, Angular, etc.
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
├── backend/           # Node.js, Python, etc.
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── ...
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

## Step 2: The Magic Command

**Open Your IDE Chat** and follow these steps:
1. **Open** a new chat window in your IDE
2. **Type** the magic command:

```
Can you test this project with TestSprite?
```

3. Drag and drop your project folder into the chat if you'd like to test a specific sub-project
4. **Press Enter**

That's it! Your AI assistant will now take over and guide you through the entire testing process.

## Step 3: The Automated Workflow

Your AI assistant will automatically execute these steps:

**1. Bootstrap Testing Environment** - The AI calls `testsprite_bootstrap_tests`, opens TestSprite configuration portal where you'll configure test settings.

**2. Generate Code Summary** - The AI calls `testsprite_generate_code_summary`, analyzes your project structure and understands your application features.

**3. Generate Standardized PRD** - The AI calls `testsprite_generate_standardized_prd`, analyzes your uploaded PRD from the configuration step, generates a normalized PRD document, and saves it to your project as `testsprite_tests/standard-prd.json`.

**4. Generate Test Plan** - The AI calls `testsprite_generate_frontend_test_plan` or `testsprite_generate_backend_test_plan`, creates comprehensive test cases and generates comprehensive test plan and individual test files.

**5. Execute Tests** - The AI calls `testsprite_generate_code_and_execute`, generates production-ready test code, runs tests in secure cloud sandbox, and returns detailed results.

## Step 4: Configuration (Required)

When the bootstrap tool opens, you must configure:

**Test Account Credentials** - If your app requires login:
```
Username: test@example.com
Password: your-test-password
```

**Application URLs:**
```
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:4000
```

**Product Requirements Document** - Upload existing PRD (required). Even a draft or low-quality PRD is fine. TestSprite AI will generate a normalized PRD based on your upload.

## Step 5: Review Test Results

After testing, you'll find these files in your project:

```
testsprite_tests/
├── tmp/
│   ├── prd_files/                 # Uploaded PRD files
│   ├── config.json               # Test configuration
│   ├── code_summary.json         # Code analysis
│   ├── report_prompt.json        # AI analysis data
│   └── test_results.json         # Detailed test results
├── standard_prd.json             # Normalized PRD
├── TestSprite_MCP_Test_Report.md # Human-readable report
├── TestSprite_MCP_Test_Report.html # HTML report
├── TC001_Login_Success_with_Valid_Credentials.py
├── TC002_Login_Failure_with_Invalid_Credentials.py
└── ...                           # Additional test files
```

**Understanding Test Results** - The test report shows overall coverage, pass rate, failed tests with detailed failure analysis, and categories (Functional, UI/UX, Security, Performance).

## Step 6: Automatic Bug Fixes

**Request Fixes** - After reviewing the test results, simply ask:

```
Please fix the codebase based on TestSprite testing results.
```

The AI will analyze failing tests, identify problematic code sections, apply targeted fixes automatically, re-run tests to verify fixes, and iterate until issues are resolved.

## Example Output

**Test Plan Generated:**
```json

      ]
    }
    // ... 17 more test cases
  ]
}
```

**Test Report Summary:**

    }
  ]
}
```

## Tips for Success

- **<span className="material-icons">gps_fixed</span> Ensure Apps Are Running** - Frontend and backend should be accessible on standard ports
- **<span className="material-icons">folder</span> Project Structure** - Include README with setup instructions and descriptive folder names  
- **<span className="material-icons">vpn_key</span> Test Credentials** - Prepare test user accounts with non-production data
- **<span className="material-icons">search</span> Review Generated Files** - Check the generated PRD and test plan for accuracy
